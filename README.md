# Movie Recommender Project

This project is a Python-based movie recommender system, utilizing a Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and modeling. The goal is to provide movie recommendations based on various features extracted from the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset.

## Project Structure

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The project begins with loading the TMDB 5000 Movie dataset and creating a new DataFrame. This step involves checking for differences in titles, handling unreleased movies, and ensuring data quality.
- **Feature Extraction**: Important features are extracted for the recommendation system. This includes handling null values and preprocessing the data by removing stopwords and non-alphabetic characters.
- **Natural Language Processing**: The project utilizes NLTK for text processing. Techniques like lemmatization and part-of-speech tagging are used to preprocess the data.
- **Data Transformation**: The content of all columns is converted into a single string for each movie. This is followed by the use of TF-IDF Vectorizer to count words and prepare the data for the recommendation engine.
- **Recommendation System**: The core of the project is building a recommendation function using cosine similarity. This function suggests movies based on similarity scores calculated from movie features.
